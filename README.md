# AgencyManagerAngularWebApi
Agency Manager application - AngularJs 1.5 components running on WebApi

## Synopsis

This is the first of a series of applications written by me to demonstrate building a simple web application using different frameworks and languages. This example is based on **SQL Server**, **MS MVC WebAPI** and **AngularJS 1.5 components**. 

The application itself is a simple app for managing interactions with recruitment agents. Agencies, agents, converstations, interviews and documents can be tracked. It's not complete - just intended as an example of the tech.

## Motivation

I am writing this series of applications to give me exposure to different technologies. The intention is to create the application once - then fork this repository and replace a language or framework. e.g. replace **SQL Server** with **MogoDb**, or **MS MVC WebAPI** with **NodeJs**.

## Installation

Grab this project from Github and run solution in **Visual Studio 2015**.
